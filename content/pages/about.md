### Animal Educator (2017/9-2018/9)

Besides being as a programmer, I also did some animal education at Taipei’s elementary school, took some animals like lizards, tarantula, or cute mammals to the elementary and talked about their stories which can developed students’ empathy and curiosity by letting them know different kinds of animals. I love to inspiring or teaching others by using interesting ways, I hope everyone can learn because they desire dig into a field that they think is really interesting rather than just getting through the tests.
