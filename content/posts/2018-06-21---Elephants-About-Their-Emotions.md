description: "如果要說與大象相處最深刻的一件事，那就是感受他們的情緒了吧，在他們身旁聽著他們因為情緒起伏而發出的各種聲音，時而發出像小奶狗的嗚噎聲、時而發出像暴龍的噠噠聲，覺得自己是如此渺小而人類又是多麼的狂妄。"

*照片中的是一歲多的Gili小女孩與Yo*

第一天認識我們的嚮導Yo時，他說“大象對人來說太大了。” “當大象為了他們自己反抗時，人們總說，這是一隻具有攻擊性的大象、這是一隻不乖的大象，但事實並非如此。”

這幾句話深深的烙印在我的腦海中，
尤其在我發現牠們與我們有多相似之後，
更是覺得我們應該對跟我們一起活在地球上的物種都有相同的同理心。

在觀察大象的第三天，我們跟一對大象母女待在一起，媽媽叫做Mae Boonsi，另一隻是個一歲多的小女孩Gili，媽媽Boonsi當時在山坡上方吃著各種植物，寶寶Gili在山坡下方，而我們站在Gili的旁邊，
Gili有時去找她喜愛的嚮導玩耍、有時倒在地上沾沾土、有時靠著樹幹抓抓癢，開心到嘴巴開開的，就像是笑得合不攏嘴的小朋友，

突然有兩隻流浪狗從草叢中出現，Gili被嚇到後 發出小象的尖叫，媽媽Boonsi在聽到她的寶寶尖叫後，馬上從山坡上一邊大吼(像電視上大象的聲音，只是音量調大一萬倍、搭配環繞音效)一邊狂奔下來，衝向我們與Gili的位置，我們(人類)馬上四散開來躲在大樹的後面，媽媽Boonsi用鼻子抓著Gili的尾巴，讓Gili不要亂跑，樹林裡此時只有媽媽Boonsi發出的噴氣混合憤怒的聲音，
那時的我覺得自己好渺小，
完全被牠們的情緒籠罩，
大象就像我們一樣，
可以玩得像小朋友、也會被嚇到尖叫、也會擔心自己的小孩、也會憤怒，

就像嚮導Yo跟我們說的一樣，大象對人可以擁有的東西來說太大了，他們並不是有攻擊性，這也許比較像是我們對於我們想控制的其他物種上強加上去的形容而已。

最後，我想謝謝在這期間幫助我了解有關大象一切的所有人，我們的嚮導Yo、Chin、ENP的Darrick、隨時看顧大象的mahout、我認識的每一隻大象，很幸運能夠從很多不同的人口中得到有關大象的故事或想法，
感覺從各個面向又再認識了大象一次，
對我來說，這次的旅行實在不太像個志工，
我想到的唯一能做的事，就是把這些事情記錄下來讓有興趣的人可以知道，

謝謝看完的人願意看完，最後附上這次參加機構的連結：https://www.elephantnaturepark.org/

# What I learned from elephants- About their Emotions

The first day we met Yo(our guide), he said “Elephant is too big to human.” When elephants fight for themselves, we see them as AGGRESSIVE ELEPHANTS or BAD ELEPHANTS, but they are not.

The sentence is just engraved in my mind,
especially after I found out how similar between humans and elephants.
I feel that we should have the same empathy for the species that live with us on earth.

On the third day of watching the elephants, we stayed with an elephant mother and her daughter. The mother called Mae Boonsi. The other was just about a one-year-old little girl, Gili. Mom Boonsi was eating plants on the hillside. Baby Gili is down the hillside, and we stand next to Gili.
Gili sometimes went to her favorite guide to play, sometimes she fell to the ground and smeared soil on her back, sometimes scratched her body against the tree, opening her mouth like a child smiling so happy.

Suddenly there were two stray dogs appearing in the bushes. Gili was scared and she screamed. The mother Boonsi immediately screamed on the hillside after hearing her baby scream (like the voice of an elephant on a television, Just 10,000 times the volume, with the surround sound) rushed down and rushed toward us and Gili’. We (human) immediately spread out to hide behind the big tree. Mom Boonsi grabbed Gili’s tail with her trunk, let Gili don’t run away.
At that moment, I felt I was immersed in the atmosphere of anger by Mom Elephant Boonsi, all over the jungle, I felt I was very small.
Elephants are just like us.
Elephants can play like a child, can be scared to scream, can worry about their child, can also be extremely angry.

Just like our guide, Yo told us, elephants are too big for what human can possess. They are not aggressive. It may be more like the description we have imposed on other species that we want to control.

I would like to thank for whom helping me understand all about the elephants during those days. Our guides Yo, Chin, ENP’s Darrick, the elephant’s mahout, every elephant I met in the jungle.
I am so lucky to be able to get stories or ideas about elephants from many different people.
I feel that I have known the elephant once again from every aspect.
For me, this trip is not really like a volunteer.
The only thing I think I can do for elephants is to write down their stories and behavior and let those who are interested know.

Thank you for reading this article, and finally attach the link to the institution which I joined this time:
